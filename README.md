# DiscordUpdater

This small update script couples with a GitHub Action to push the latest commit to a Discord message

## Usage

The Action should be installed automatically on any new repositories created from the [ExampleExtension template](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/ExampleExtension/), but if you would like to install it manually on a repository in the "Project-Cepi" organization, here are the steps.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Project-Cepi/DiscordUpdater/releases/) and upload it to the root of the GitHub repository

2. Click Actions > New Action and scroll down to "Update Discord"

3. Click "Set up this workflow"

4. Commit your changes

5. Done!
